<p>When I try to create a file in a directory, I was blocked outside the folder with "bash: cd: test: Permission denied".</p>
<p>The permission of the folder is 654, and I am not the owner or in the owner group, but I thought "4" means I have the read permission of the folder, which means that I could get into the folder, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>permission "x" has different meanings for regular files and folders.</p>
<ul>
<li>For regular file: "x" means you can&nbsp;</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
